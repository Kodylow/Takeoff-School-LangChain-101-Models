## This Lesson

We'll be covering all of the main modules of LangChain in LangChain 101.

Today's focus is on models.

## LangChain

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

It provides helpful classes that we can use to easily interface with these models.

You can connect to all sorts of models, but in this lesson we'll be using OpenAI.

## Prerequisites

While this course is fairly beginner friendly, you may want some basic Python experience.

We recommend 2 things:
1) [Replit's 100 days of Python](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python/hub)
2) [Takeoff School's "Your 1st AI App" Course](https://replit.com/@MckayWrigley/Takeoff-School-Your-1st-AI-App?v=1)

Neither is necessary, but they can be helpful!

# Tips

## Use ChatGPT!

If you get stuck, try asking [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to help you!

This is a gamechanging way to learn. Take advantage of it.

Ask it questions, paste in bugs, ask for explanations, etc.

ChatGPT will become your best friend as you learn to code.
